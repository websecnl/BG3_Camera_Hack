This project is the same thing as: https://github.com/shalzuth/BG3Cam

So Special Thanks to @shalzuth for the inspiration :)

The main difference between his code and ours is that we made a ImGui variant of it (Interactable from within the game instead of outside the game).


# Usage

1. Compile the project

2. Use "Process Hacker" or some other x64 Injector to inject the DLL into the game process

3. Press Insert in game to show or hide the menu
